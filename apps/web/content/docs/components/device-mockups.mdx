description: Use the device mockups component to add content and screenshot previews of your application inside phone and tablet frames coded with Tailwind CSS and Flowbite
---

The device mockup component can be used to feature a preview and screenshot of your application as if you would already use it on a mobile phone and it’s a great use case for hero and CTA sections.

This component is built using only the utility classes from Tailwind CSS and has built-in dark mode support so it’s easy to customize, it loads very fast and integrates perfectly with Tailwind CSS and Flowbite.

You can choose from multiple examples of mockups including phone, tablet, laptop, and even desktop devices with iOS or Android support.

To start using the mockup components you need to import them from `flowbite-react`:

```jsx
import {
  DefaultMockup,
  DesktopMockup,
  GooglePixelMockup,
  IPhone12Mockup,
  LaptopMockup,
  SmartwatchMockup,
  TabletMockup,
} from "flowbite-react";
```

## Default mockup

Use this example to show a standard phone mockup based on Tailwind CSS and add your app screenshot inside of it with dark mode support included.

<Example name="mockup.root" />

## iPhone 12 mockup (iOS)

Use this example to clearly show that the preview of your application is being used on an iPhone with iOS.

<Example name="mockup.iPhone12" />

## Google Pixel (Android)

<Example name="mockup.googlePixel" />
